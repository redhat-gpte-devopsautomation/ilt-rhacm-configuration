This folder holds the root configuration for the cluster. Everything in this folder goes on the hub cluster.

This includes:
- Policies
- Application Subscriptions

Application Subscriptions can go on just one cluster (e.g. the hub cluster). Then all YAML resources
can be in the application directory.

Or application subscriptions can go onto multiple clusters. If multiple clusters get the same subscription
use the label as the subdirectory. For cluster-specific application subscriptions use the cluster
name as the subdirectory.

Deploying this folder as an application to the hub cluster will cascade all other settings.
